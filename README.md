Mapping the biogenesis of forward programmed megakaryocytes from induced
pluripotent stem cells by Moyra Lawrence \*, Arash Shahsavari \*,
Susanne Bornel√∂v \*, Thomas Moreau, Katarzyna Kania, Maike Paramor,
Rebecca McDonald, James Baye, Marion Perrin, Maike Steindel,
Paula Jimenez-Gomez, Christopher Penfold, Irina Mohorianu, and Cedric Ghevaert

The data is presented in csv files, named by their date - in case there were
several replicates in one month, they are named as month-year-1.csv,
month-year-2.csv, etc. There is also an example.csv, generated by subsampling
one of the csvs.

The colony variable is binary (Y/N) in all csvs, with wells scored as follows:
Wells containing a colony of more than 3 megakaryocytes on D9-14 of culture
were scored as positive observations; colonies containing fewer than 3 cells
were scored as negative.

csvs do not contain information on the number of cells except for
september-2020-1-cells-per-plate.csv, which contains the info from some plates
in september-2020-1.csv, but with an added column describing the
number of cells per plate.
